A video Game inspired 'Randomiser'.
Created using Vanilla HTML, CSS & JS.

The game randomises a character, role and challenge for each player (up to 5).
Then dishes out random forfeit to either be given out by the player, or given to the player, depending on their success.
You can check the console to see the objects of each player, tracking their selections.
